title: $:/plugins/wikilabs/info-session/readme

This plugin provides a tiddler info button, with a persistent open/close status ''for one session''. The status is saved in a "state/popup" variable. This means, if you reload the TW, the status is gone!

If you want permanently persistent variables, you need to use the "info-persistent-plugin" instead!

This plugin doesn't change any core templates.
